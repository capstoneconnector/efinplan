# Retrospective

## Jared Brown
At the Symposium, I did not see many people walking by who would want to view our presentation. A small amount of people stopped by, but mostly only the other computer science students wanted to hear the explanation of our project. 
As for the judges, they did not seem to understand the workings of the computer science capstone even after our explanation. They asked things such as how our project was innovative, useful, the money that could be gained from it, and other miscellaneous things that were more questions for MoneyTree rather than us.
They really liked the poster, but I had to explain to them multiple times that we do not know what the company will do with our software after we hand it off. Obviously, we understand the business requirements, but it isn't our job to know how this product can be marketed or profitable. Overall, explaining it to the judges was rather annoying, considering that they did not understand my explanations and because they were rude.

My experience at the Symposium was overall positive, however I am a bit disappointed not many people asked about our project. Only other computer science students came and spoke to us about our project. It felt like we were out of place being next to projects about paleontology and conservation. When the judges were asking us questions, it almost seemed like they were confused about why we were there, saying "I just don't see how this is innovative." Besides that, I was glad to be able to share our project with the considerate CS students who stopped by.
