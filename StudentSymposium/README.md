# Retrospective

## Jared Brown
At the Symposium, I did not see many people walking by who would want to view our presentation. A small amount of people stopped by, but mostly only the other computer science students wanted to hear the explanation of our project. 
As for the judges, they did not seem to understand the workings of the computer science capstone even after our explanation. They asked things such as how our project was innovative, useful, the money that could be gained from it, and other miscellaneous things that were more questions for MoneyTree rather than us.
They really liked the poster, but I had to explain to them multiple times that we do not know what the company will do with our software after we hand it off. Obviously, we understand the business requirements, but it isn't our job to know how this product can be marketed or profitable. Overall, explaining it to the judges was rather annoying, considering that they did not understand my explanations and because they were rude.

My experience at the Symposium was overall positive, however I am a bit disappointed not many people asked about our project. Only other computer science students came and spoke to us about our project. It felt like we were out of place being next to projects about paleontology and conservation. When the judges were asking us questions, it almost seemed like they were confused about why we were there, saying "I just don't see how this is innovative." Besides that, I was glad to be able to share our project with the considerate CS students who stopped by.

I had a great time at the symposium. I thoroughly enjoyed wandering around and hearing about other peoples projects. It was especially cool to hear about non-CS projects as I don't often get to see the work of other majors. I appreciated how people showed interest in our project despite the generally boring nature of finances and financial planning. Unfortunately there weren't a ton of people interested, mostly just other CS students who have heard of the project before. Overall I would say it was a good experience.

## Noah Perez
The Symposium was a lot more crowded than I had imagined. It was cool seeing all the other projects from our fellow capstone classmates along with some of the other projects from different categories. Did feel a little weird as we were mostly surrounded by non CS projects but was able to walk around and see others. Not many people came up to us while I was there but the few that did were pretty polite and actually interested in our project. The  judges that came by were a bit confused about the project and some of their questions we could not answer for them so it was a bit frustrating.
