## Topics Discussed
*   Business Requirements
	* Business requirements are good but need simplification
	* Some are more like use cases
		* Think of the goal of the platform rather than just what it is supposed to do
*   Use Cases
	* All seem to be adequately abstracted
	* Some wording issues
		* Content is not published to the site, its added to a library of content links
		* Do tagging and searching need to be separated
			* Yes because of example use cases found in the course's materials
*  Requirements
	* Many, many requirements
	* Some are similar to others, but they shouldn't be united
		* Make sure that each requirement is not actually two
	* Nonfunctional requirements
		* Not much because of the site's status as locally hosted
		* Should still follow accessibility guidelines
		* Should follow the theming of MoneyTree products
		* Should be reasonably fast to open
*   Architecture
	* Diagram looks good
	* Will probably change based on template files given to us by the client
	* Does a good enough job for what we currently have
*   Domain Model
	* UML diagram fits all the parts of the domain
	* Functions may be added or removed in the future
		* Only added functions so that we can remember specific things like tagging
*   TechStack
	* Follows exactly what the client requires
*  Prototype
	* Looks good, will unfortunately need a lot of rework in the future due to MoneyTree theming
	* May need many changes due to updates of information regarding MoneyTree Plan API
	* Flow is what is expected of a web app


## Things Clarified
* Business requirements will need to be changed to be more simplified
* Use Cases can use some better wording
* Revise requirements based on excellent requirement definitions
* Prototype is good and does the best we can do for now
* After fixing the business requirements, use cases, and refining the requirements, we should be good to meet with the client on the 12th
