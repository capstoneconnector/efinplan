## Topics Discussed
* Showcase
  * Updates from last iteration, UI changes like the week view instead of thirty days
* Financial planning prototypes done
  * Looks like exactly what the clients wanted
* What questions should we ask?
  * Ryland will ask Matthew to get them for us
* Don't really have a way to split it up between people yet until we can get the questions
* A lot of conditional logic on the frontend
* Backend side should be relatively easy
  * Calling their API generates a PDF that can be saved for viewing later
  * May try to get SMTP access? Unlikely
* Advisors may be able to look at the plans, but will probably just be an attachment for the appointments
* Will continue to work on updates for appointments

## Things Clarified
* Ryland will get a list of questions for Matthew so that we can implement them in the planning page
* Team will continue to work on updates from last iteration
