## Topics Discussed
* Showed off backend (API Project)
  * Make sure to test using in-memory db
  * This can be containerized in Docker
  * We won't deploy in AWS just yet, the client will probably do that
  * Can be used to fill in content in private until the public release
  * Should not make login and registration system yet
  * .NET takes care of request models, we don't need to define them
* Frontend
  * Will get style guide eventually
  * Continue building off prototype
* Web Project
  * Just connects backend and frontend
* Core Project
  * Good separation of models, views, and controllers
  * Models defined well
  * DB Context defined well
* SDK
  * Will be most usable part by end of first iteration
  * Going well
* Documentation
  * Development.md looks great
  * Our Solution follows the guidelines from Confluence
  * Testing is good, Xunit is fine


## Things Clarified
* Continue working on frontend based on Prototype
* Ask Ryland for any problems
* No logging in or registration system yet
* We should containerize, but not deploy
* Continue on rest of Solution as we are
