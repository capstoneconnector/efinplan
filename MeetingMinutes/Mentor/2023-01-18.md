## Topics Discussed
* Plan of features
  * Appointments, get base for it
  * Financial planning, also a base
  * Only those two features

* Is this plan okay?
  * Financial planning needs the calculator API to be fixed first, so we should not do this until later
  * Focus on appointments
    * Get a detailed implementation of it instead of a baseline
  * Easily consolidates our work under one topic
