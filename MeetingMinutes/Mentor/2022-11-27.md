## Topics Discussed
* Talk about what we have done so far
  * Jared is working on favoriting and search
    * Should both types of users be able to search?
      * Yes
    * Who should be able to favorite?
      * Only Investors, Advisors won't be reading content much
      * Favoriting shows up as a tab on the frontend to show only favorited posts
    * For now, searching is just by name of the content
  * Desiree is working on the calculators on the frontend
    * Using the SDK we made
    * Will put the SDK on the backend so it can be called on the frontend
  * Joah and Noah are working on logging in
    * Will meet again with Ryland to talk more in depth about certain issues like tokens
    * Unknown if we have access to a SMTP system
    * Two separate logging in systems for Advisors and Investors
    * Every request to the backend will require a token
* What can Ryland help with?
  * Getting styling docs if we can get them yet, may not style this iteration if too late
  * Getting token information
  * Will we be able to use SMTP?
  * Are there examples of logging in somewhere we can look at?


## Things Clarified
* Continue working
* Will meet with Ryland again later to get more info about styling, tokens, and email
