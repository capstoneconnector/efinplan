## Things Clarified
* We will use the new linters added for the .NET and Vue side of things
* Appointments can be declined from either side, but only Investors can schedule them

## Topics Discussed
* We need to speed up our development
* Tasks are distributed evenly
* Work on the frontend can be done before Jared finishes the backend using mock data
* Styling will be done last, but Des can still help with frontend until then
* The backend will be started once we refactor things to follow Ergin's suggestions from before
* We need more tests done, so plan to spend a day after all this is done to test it thoroughly
* How will appointments be notified to users?
  * We don't have an SMTP server to use, since this is a test program for MoneyTree
  * So, notifications should just be pop ups that do not go away until confirmed
  * When an Investor makes an appointment, it stores a cookie that will start false and continue to notify the user the day before until they accept
  * For Advisors, they will be notified when they are scheduled, and can cancel or accept from the appointments menu
* Styling will be different from the prototype, we will figure that out later

## Tasks Distributed
* Jared
  * Will continue to work on appointments backend
* Desiree
  * Will continue to work on styling the appointments page
* Joah
  * Will continue to work on the advisor side
* Noah
  * Will continue to work on the investor side
