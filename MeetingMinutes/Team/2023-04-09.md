## Things Clarified
* Access to Vestorly API is no longer happening due to it being bought out by another company and will no longer share access.

## Topics Discussed
* What needs to be done?
  * Connecting our survey response to the MoneyTree API
    * Store response in database
    * Display the response from their API
    * Use a graph library to show the results more clearly
  *Styling project more to our liking
    *Since Vestorly is no longer able to be accessed, we were told by client Matthew Garrett to just work on styling instead
	*
* Who can do what?
  * Joah and Joah can work on connecting the MoneyTree API to the survey
  * Des and Noah can work on the styling and graphing
* What is currently blocking us?
  * Other than the vestorely access not being available, I believe on of the financial calculators may not be fully ready
