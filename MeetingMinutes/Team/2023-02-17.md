  * No more calculators for now
  * Will be similar to the New York City site that the clients showed us
  * We still need a user flow
* Ideas for user flow?
  * Ask simple questions, one at a time
  * No analysis paralysis
  * Allow user to pick whether they want to plan out social security, education, or just a monetary amount
